# Security

In accordance with the [disclose.io](https://disclose.io) core terms, essentials define the following:

## Scope

Any vulnerability in the essentials repository that either results in an unintended loss of funds or results in grievance for potential users are covered under the responsible disclosure program.

## Rewards

Since essentials is a volunteer OSS right now, I am unable to provide any rewards. But if the scope of vulnerability is huge and other packages that use this are affected, I will make sure they reward you according to the scope of the vulnerability.

## Official Communication Channels

1. Personal Message to "Varunram" on freenode IRC
2. Preferably Encrypted Email to contact@varunram.com. [Our PGP Key](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&fingerprint=on&search=0x708C606504A49970) fingerprint is `C98F 0014 9A99 36E4 E56D  2471 708C 6065 04A4 9970`  

If you do not receive a reply within one day, please do send a reminder so I can act at the earliest.  

## Disclosure Policy

I believe in a coordinated disclosure program where vulnerability details may be shared with the public after the vulnerability has been fixed and the program owner has provided permission to disclose or after 90 days from submission, whichever is sooner.

I thank anyone who plans to report a vulnerability in advance and hope to work with you on a fix as soon as possible.
