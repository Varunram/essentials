// Package assets contains asset related functions like calculating AssetID and
// sets up DebtAssets, PaybackAssets and InvestorAssets for a specific project that it has been
// passed
// The entities in the system are described in the README file and this part
// will explain how the PaybackAssets, InvestorAssets and DebtAssets work.

// 1. InvestorAsset - An InvestorAsset is issued by the issuer for every USD that the investor
// has invested in the contract. This peg needs to be ensured maybe in protocol
// with stablecoins on Stellar or we need to provide an easy onboarding scheme
// for users into the crypto world using other means. The investor receives
// InvestorAssets as proof of investment but profit return mechanism is not taken into
// account here, since that needs clear definition on how much investors get each
// period for investing in the project.

// 2. DebtAsset - for each InvestorAsset (and indirectly, USD invested in the project),
// we issue a DebtAsset to the recipient of the assets so that they can pay us back.
// DebtAssets are also lunked with PaybackAssets and they should be immutable as well,
// so that the issuer can not change the amount of debt at any point in the future.
// MW: Mention that DebtAssets are not equal to InvestorAssets since there must be an interest %
// that needs to be paid to investors, which is also part of the DebtAsset

// 3. PaybackAsset - each PaybackAsset denotes a month of appropriate payback. A month's worth
// of payback is decided by the recipient, who decides the payback period of the
// given assets at the time of creation. PaybackAssets are non-fungible, it means
// that one project's payback asset is not worth the same as the other project's PaybackAsset.
// the other two assets are fungible - each InvestorAsset is worth +1USD and each DebtAsset
// is worth -1 USD and can be transferred to other peers willing to take profit / debt
// on behalf of the above entities. SInce PaybackAsset is not fungible, the flag
// authorization_required needs to be set and a party without a trustline with
// the issuer can not trade in this asset (and ideally, the issuer will not accept
// trustlines in this new asset)
// PaybackAssets in general are not always an arbitrary decision of the recipient,
// rather its set by an agreement of utility or rent payment, tied to the information from
//  an IoT device (i.e a powermeter in the case of solar).

// The hard part is ensuring that the assets are pegged to the USD in a stable way.
// we could ensure the peg ourselves by accepting USD off chain, but that's not provable
// on chain and the investor has to trust the issuer with that. Also, in this case,
// anonymous investors wouldn't be able to invest, which is something that would be
// nice to have

// AssetID assigns a unique assetID to each asset. We assume that there won't be more
// than 68719476736 (16^9) assets that are created at any point, so we're good.
// the total AssetID must be less than 12 characters in length, so we take the first
// three for a human readable identifier and then the last 9 are random hex characaters
// passed through SHA3
